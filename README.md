# Brain-tumor-detection
This project is about creating an image classification model to detect
whether an MRI image of a brain has a tumor or not. The model is created using
Fast ai, which is a high-level deep learning library built on top of Py Torch. The
dataset used in this project contains MRI images of brains with and without
tumors. The model is trained using transfer learning with ResNet18 and
ResNet34 as the base architectures. After training the model, it is exported and
used to make predictions on new images using a simple web interface built with
widgets.
